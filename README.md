Library to controle LEDs through a Teensy with using acccelerometer and RC receiver input

* LEDHardwareAbstraction for creating virtual LED strips from different LED strips controlled over different pins on the Teensy/Arduino
* LEDEffect for implementation of various effects on LEDs
* ParameterChange for an abstraction of Parameters to use in LEDEffects
* RenderTimer for a block free timer implementation that allows you to run different timers for different purposes and different delay times
* Nightflight for implementing a controller class to put all together
